## FAQ
<details>
<summary>What is GitHub Copilot?</summary><br>
   
GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI. It is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

<summary>What is GitHub Codespaces?</summary><br>
   
A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by configuring dev container files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project. 

GitHub Codespaces run on a variety of VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. You can connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.

Please note that during the GitHub Copilot+Codespaces demo, the suggestions generated by GitHub Copilot via Codespaces will differ and may not always be the same. This is due to GitHub Copilot being an artificial intelligent tool that generates code suggestions based on the input it receives.
